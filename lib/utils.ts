what inspired you to get into Web Development - I got into web development because I love creating things people enjoy using. The frontend always fascinated me‚Äîhow a simple animation or design can make an experience feel special. But as I explored more, I realized there‚Äôs so much behind the scenes‚Äîservers, data, logic‚Äîthat makes everything work. That discovery made me want to build complete, reliable apps.

I knew I didn‚Äôt want to just focus on one side. I wanted to do it all‚Äîdesign beautiful interfaces and build solid backend systems. Becoming a full-stack developer felt right because I want to create seamless, meaningful experiences that feel human and effortless. For me, it‚Äôs about making something that truly matters.
